## Focus

* focus - determines were keyboard elements go on the page
* all page functionality should be available by using the keyboard
* no mouse, more productive
* show highlight in fields for focus
* **implicitly focusable:** automatically in the tab order + build-in keyboard event handling
* DOM order matters = tab order

* keys:
  * `tab` moves focus forward
  * `shift` + `tab` moves focus backwards
  * arrow keys move focus within a component
  * `space bar` selects/de-selects
